          <h1>Researchers</h1>
          <p>
            Are you looking to get involved with our team of researchers and
            academics? Our museum offers various ways for you to use our
            resources and contribute towards them. We have online records,
            laboratory space, and a working relationship with a number of
            universities around the country.

        <h2>Explore</h2>
        <div>
          <p>
            Over the course of human history, science has developed from our
            early understanding of fire, wind, water, and earth to exploring
            everything from galaxies far away to the very building blocks of
            life itself. The aim of our museum is to create a space where
            everyone can experience the wonders of our discoveries and perhaps
            even ignite a lifelong passion to continue the exploration of the
            world around us. We believe science should not be confined to the
            textbook, but brought to live through exhibits. This is why we have
            over 1000 different exhibits on the many varied subjects of science
            to explore. Many of these exhibits are designed for you to interact
            with and play around to see science come to life (apart from the
            dinosaur exhibits – they only come to life at night when everyone’s
            gone home).

              Are you a young person looking to learn more about science? Come
              on down to our museum, there’s plenty to see and do. You can learn
              about Newtonian physics from our bumper swing, or why not travel
              back in time and meet our resident Woolly Mammoth? Our exhibits
              are designed to be accessible for interested minds, so make sure
              you come ready to learn and explore. We also have the Young Stars
              club which meets once a week on a Saturday between 10:00 and 13:00
              where you’ll get to explore and experiment with our team of
              experts. During the school holidays we run special holiday clubs
              where you can join other children your age to go on a journey of
              discovery. Each holiday we pick a new theme to explore. To find
              out more about the holiday club and how you can join, send us a
              message.

              As a community-driven museum, we want to work with schools to
              create places of learning and exploring. Our team are on hand to
              give your students guided tours of the museum, teach them in our
              learning laboratory, and provide great video presentations that
              will excite and inspire them. Please get in touch with us here to
              find out more about our facilities and to arrange a time to bring
              your students through for a visit.
